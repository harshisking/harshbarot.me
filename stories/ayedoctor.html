  <h1>Aye Doctor</h1>
  <div class="story-meta">Last Updated: 09/01/2026 • Status: Ongoing</div>

  <p>
    Dr Sharma was the most famous guy in the neighbourhood. Even children greeted him with respect. He was a tall and lean guy, mid 40s. He dressed like he was the family doctor of the prime minister, maybe he was. He owned two beasts, a Mercedes G-Wagon and a Porsche 911.
  </p>

  <p>
    It was a fine day, I was cleaning my balcony and the garden it held. My eyes met him while he was moving towards his car, hauling a suitcase, and all of that in casual clothes. This was no ordinary event, the man who wore fully fledged suits, was out in pajamas and a Tshirt that read, “Vacation Vibes”, with palm trees and an orange sun.
  </p>
  <p>
   “Hey, Dr. Sharma, going somewhere?” I managed from the first floor.
“Hello, Ansh,” he said, “yes, going to a buds wedding”, *thack* his suitcase toppled over.

As he was hauling the goods in, I saw a dark figure in the Porsche passenger seat, sitting still, intending to be ignored.

“Well see you later Ansh, getting late” and he took off in the mobile.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I got back to cleaning as it wasn’t my business to attend to. I only figured by his bag that the wedding was going to be long. I enjoyed the five days without the doctor being around, though I cannot say I would be for what followed.

It was a fine Sunday, I had just returned from the parlour and indulged myself in some motorsports. Ramesh, the gatekeeper, knocked on my door.
“Ansh, your car needs to be moved. The organisers are here for tomorrow’s event”

I moved the car out of the way, into the visitors parking.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Curse his name mother! That clot has left, probably with his mistress. She would rot for eternity!!”
It was Mrs Sharma screaming on her phone. I was surprised and not, he was a man with handsome money and reputation afterall. I crept back to my flat, and consequently lost 300 in betting. I slept sound reflecting on my loss and worrying bout the Monday. 
  </p>

  <p>
    The day had begun, I brewed some coffee and submitted my designs for the new hybrid engine, our methods yielded reduction on carbon emission. As expected the designs were marked green and I was checkered for the day. It was 1 pm, I fired up the tv, and was scrolling channels, when I heard
“A Porsche 911 was found totalled by Tilak Circle. No victims were found. Police have taken the car in and are actively trying to contact the owner. Here is the picture of car, crashed in the tree”
  </p>
  <p>
    It was yellow, the same as Dr Sharma’s, the medical society logo, and the characteristic scratches confirmed to me the owner, the doctor. My analysis was disrupted by loud knocks. It was senior Mr. Sharma. The news had reached them, and their panic brought them here. The doctress had already packed and left the day before.

The seniors were cool sort of people. They spent half their time with me as the doctor was busy attending his clinic. I am a bachelor and often my work allows me free time. It was a routine for me to drive with them. The arrogant doctor’s parents were humble and kind to me. We got in the car and drove to the police station. Inspector Dubey seemed helpful and only seemed. He gave us a list of all the items obtained at the crash site. Nothing in mind, we drove to the crash site, it was a tad inside, near the canal. It was cleaned already. As we were returning back to the car, I saw something…
  </p>

  <p>
    A shoe, a black loafer with just enough polish to shine. That was it, doctor’s shoe. I was excited by the discovery but found it smelling of liquor. I examined the shoe with disgust that turned into worry. There were blood spatters on the inside and the tip. The position suggested that the blood travelled through his legs to the inside and the tip bit was acquired from the upper body. The sole also contained traces of some fresh mud, odd for a concrete canal. We placed the shoe in a plastic bag from the car. Sensing from the blood, I was sure to find him in some hospital. The nearest one disappointed us, the next one too, and so did all the ones in the five kilometer radius. We returned to the apartment with worried hearts and shocked Mrs Sharma. We let her rest in the guest room. I suggested the same to Mr Sharma, “not now Ansh, lets first talk about what we have here.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Where would he be going at the start of the week?”
  </p>
   <p>
    “A buds wedding, he told me”
  </p>
  <p>
    “A wedding, he never attends on work days and besides his friends haven’t seen him since last month, we called them.”
  </p>
  <p>
    “There was someone in the passenger seat. I couldn’t see it though,” I spoke carefully,”It wasn’t his wife, sure of that”
I begun, “I also heard his wife cursing him and talking bout a mistress on her phone”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Mistress?”, he exclaimed confused
  </p>
  <p>
    “yes , he was also holding her luggage”
  </p>
  <p>
    “Luggage!” he exclaimed, “There was no luggage in the list Inspector Dubey gave me”
  </p>
  <p>
    I pressured my mind to recall some details. It was white, coloured spots, it had a name tag too, a quite large one, two letters, “AK”, and a cat drawn on it too. Mr Sharma noted the description and then began our conquest to find the mysterious mistress AK.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Quite a lot of people have them, initials AK” said Mr Sharma
  </p>
  <p>
    “Only women” I interjected
  </p>
  <p>
    “Not any that we know, except for his aunt, they never got along so check her off the list”
  </p>
  <p>
    It was evident that the mistress would’ve been from his workplace, gym, swimming classes, or someone he met on dating apps, though the latter is less likely. This was an assumption that he had a mistress, and guess who knows he has a mistress, his wife, she must have some proof. We weren’t the lot she would give the information easily. A play was in order. Mr Sharma told Mrs Sharma that the wife was spreading rumors bout the doctor’s mistress. Mrs Sharma was infuriated with rage, and as we finally pulled over in the wife’s expected hideout, her mother’s. And she was there too, returning with shopping bags. Mrs Sharma’s rage unleashed on the wife and thus began a fight. A fight through which we both bled our ears. The cursing went on for fifteen minutes, and finally the wife agreed to show us the proof of the doctor’s chronicles. 
  </p>
  <p>
The furious woman showed us a photo, a photo of the doctor with a female, both wearing white cloaks. The doctor was visible but hair covered the woman’s face. She had black hair, almost the height of the doctor. She wore a bracelet with golden sparks. The photo wasn’t much of an evidence, she could be just a colleague.
