  <h1>Off The Books</h1>
  <div class="story-meta">Last Updated: 09/01/2026 • Status: On-Hold</div>

  <p>
    The room was washed with blinding lights. Cigarette smoke lingered in the air.
<br>One table. Three chairs.
<br>One was occupied. The other two waited on the opposite side.
<br>He was cuffed to the table with one hand. The other held a cigarette, steady, unhurried.
<br>I entered the room with my partner <strong>Dhruv Siri</strong>. My name is <strong>Ram Mohan</strong>. We had a single file between us - just one - with the name <strong>Kian Dharm</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    He had volunteered to give us information on Dante, the crime lord the state had decided not to take alive.
<br>We took the vacant chairs. Dhruv had already begun to tap his pen, “There is nothing in his file”, he whispered. How could a man with no record nor any connections would know about Dante.
<br>“Mr. Dharm, my officers tell me you have information about Dante. They also said that your demands are… uncommon.” I said, “They are” he spoke with utter calmness and politeness.
  </p>
  <p>
    “Mr. Dharm, what information are you willing to give us?”, “his location” he replied. “And how” I asked carefully, “did you find him?”. “It's not hard to find anyone for me.” he replied.
<br>“Well then pray tell”,
<br>“You fulfil your end of the deal, then I would mine”,
<br>“You want a free ticket out of the country with a new identity. What do you think assures us that your intel is valid”, I spoke pointing to his file, “when we don’t even know who you are”,
<br>“My father worked with Dante... more like he worked for my father”,
<br>“I think this is it, you will be charged for wasting the governments resources”,
<br>“A week ago, ” he said, “Bhatt was found dead, shot himself, but did he… Kareem had killed him.”
<br>“How did he know?” I asked myself. The crime scene was so clean. It took us 6 days to figure this out, let alone a common man but he was not a common man, was he?
